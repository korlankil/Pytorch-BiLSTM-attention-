<text>this place doesn't compare with mamoun's in terms of price, freshness, value, and consisent quality, but that's just my opinion.</text>

<Polarity>1</Polarity>
<text>i had a terrific meal, and our server guided us toward a very nice wine in our price range, instead of allowing us to purchase a similarly priced wine that wasn't as good.</text>

<text>we actually left hungry and went across the street to wo hop at 15 mott street for some good chinese food.</text>

<text>despite the fact that the space is large, they've overcrowded the floor with tables.</text>

<Polarity>1</Polarity>
<text>friendly and informative staff, very attentive and prompt raw bar service.</text>

<Polarity>1</Polarity>
<text>when my dessert came, there was a candle in it - not because anyone asked for one - but because the waiter must have seen me opening my birthday card and gift, and said he knew it was a special occassion of some sort.</text>

<Polarity>1</Polarity>
<text>the food was average or above including some surprising tasty dishes.</text>

<Polarity>1</Polarity>
<text>your friends will thank you for introducing them to this gem!</text>

<text>as a fan of thai, i have tried quite a few different restaurants in nyc and this one was definitely the worst.</text>

<Polarity>0</Polarity>
<text>i must warn the reader that the portions sizes are very small (especially the appetizers), so if you plan to eat until you are full and do not intend to order the chef's special tasting menu, prepare to order and pay for an appetizer (1 dish for each person because the portions are not for sharing), a main entree, and the cold udon at the end of the meal.</text>

<text>i have been a longtime fan of holy basil in the east village, and while i do believe their food has slightly slipped in quality, i have been hesitant to be disloyal.</text>

<text>the hanger steak was like rubber and the tuna was flavorless not to mention it tasted like it had just been thawed.</text>

<text>the chicken parm was edible but had canned tomato sauce and boxed pasta and the chicken with portobello mushrooms consisted of dry, inedible chicken with terrible sauce.</text>

<text>they also have a back garden open in the summer - cute and french with outdoor seating - what more could you ask for?</text>
