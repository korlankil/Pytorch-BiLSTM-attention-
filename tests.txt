<text>service was among the best i have ever had in nyc.</text>

<text>and as soon as one person is done, she asked to pick up the plate immediately.</text>

<text>this made it obvious that the food wasn't cooked fresh; it was obviously made before hand and then reheated.</text>

<text>for the price you pay for the food here, you'd expect it to be at least on par with other japanese restaurants.</text>

<text>the appetizers are ok, but the service is slow.</text>

<text>if you're looking for authentic hong kong-style food, look no further.</text>

<text>well, it happened because of a graceless manager and a rude bartender who had us waiting 20 minutes for drinks, and then tells us to chill out.</text>

<Polarity>1</Polarity>
<text>we been there and we really enjoy the food, was areally great food, and the service was really good.</text>

<text>when the dish arrived it was blazing with green chillis, definitely not edible by a human.</text>

<text>personally i say save your money.</text>

<text>i have no idea why this restaurant is so often overlooked.</text>

<Polarity>0</Polarity>
<text>our waitress had apparently never tried any of the food, and there was no one to recommend any wine.</text>

<Polarity>1</Polarity>
<text>had a great experience at trio ... staff was pleasant; food was tasty and large in portion size - i would highly recommend the portobello/gorgonzola/sausage appetizer and the lobster risotto.</text>

<text>the management was less than accomodating.</text>

<text>i had to flag down a third staff person for a fork... so now it's goodbye little rude pie company.</text>

<text>the service was a bit slow and the portions are a bit small so if you are hungry and in a rush, this is not the place for you.</text>

<text>didn't seem like any effort was made to the display and quality of the food.</text>

<text>a nice space, as long as it doesn't get too crowded and a singleminded devotion to its chosen cuisine make mare a great choice for seafood lovers.</text>

<text>while it was large and a bit noisy, the drinks were fantastic, and the food was superb.</text>

<text>everything about this place was wonderful.</text>

<text>do yourself a favor and avoid this place at all cost!</text>

<text>the food was delicious and clearly fresh ingredients were used.</text>

<text>atmosphere is a bore.</text>

<text>also, the chick peas with shrimp (appetizer) is divine.</text>

<text>the food is good, the teriyaki i recommend.</text>

<text>the food really isn't very good and the service is terrible.</text>

<Polarity>1</Polarity>
<text>definitely try the taglierini with truffles - it was incredible.</text>

<Polarity>1</Polarity>
<text>everything from the eggs benedict to the mussels and even the hamburger were done well and very tasty.</text>

<text>yes, they're a bit more expensive then typical, but then again, so is their food.</text>

<Polarity>1</Polarity>
<text>we were pleasantly surprised with our choice.</text>

<Polarity>0</Polarity>
<text>the wait staff was loud and inconsiderate.</text>

<Polarity>1</Polarity>
<text>this is still one of my most favorite restaurants in the area the food is inexpensive but very good (kimono shrimp special was excellent) and has a great atmosphere.</text>

<Polarity>1</Polarity>
<text>while there's a decent menu, it shouldn't take ten minutes to get your drinks and 45 for a dessert pizza.</text>

<Polarity>1</Polarity>
<text>from the beginning, we were met by friendly staff memebers, and the convienent parking at chelsea piers made it easy for us to get to the boat.</text>

<Polarity>1</Polarity>
<text>the service is excellent and always informative without an air.</text>
