<text>also, because it is so thin, it gets cold very quickly and its not that filling.</text>

<text>the pizza is delicious and the proprietor is one of the nicest in nyc.</text>

<text>the lobster sandwich is $24 and although it was good it was not nearly enough to warrant that price.</text>

<Polarity>1</Polarity>
<text>this place has many different styles of pizza and they are all amazing.</text>

<Polarity>1</Polarity>
<text>the sauce on the pizza is sooo good with garlic and fresh tomatoes and they don't skimp.</text>

<text>of course this atmosphere is lacking, but what do you expect from a 24 hour bagel place anyways?</text>

<Polarity>0</Polarity>
<text>okay-i don't mind the oily part (cause most are cooked that way) but it was way too bland.</text>

<Polarity>0</Polarity>
<text>in reality (to maximize potential diners) they were still taking phone reservations and reallocating tables of those waiting in the lobby.</text>

<Polarity>1</Polarity>
<text>the design and atmosphere is just as good.</text>

<Polarity>0</Polarity>
<text>we ordered the special, grilled branzino, that was so infused with bone, it was difficult to eat.</text>

<text>the most annoying thing, though, is the fact that the servers seem to be trained to drive revenue.</text>

<text>murray won't do it.</text>

<text>while this isn't classical restaurant fare, the chef has given new life to an old cuisine with some really innovative and tasty dishes that are genuinely indian without being heavy or same old restaurant burn-outs.</text>

<text>if you were there when it first opened, give this restaurant a second chance.</text>

<Polarity>0</Polarity>
<text>this restaurant is not worth the time, effort, or money to say the least.</text>

<Polarity>1</Polarity>
<text>word of advice, save room for pasta dishes and never leave until you've had the tiramisu.</text>

<Polarity>0</Polarity>
<text>yes, they use fancy ingredients, but even fancy ingredients don't make for good pizza unless someone knows how to get the crust right.</text>

<Polarity>0</Polarity>
<text>my turkey burger was not cooked at all, my friends salmon was completely raw.</text>

<Polarity>1</Polarity>
<text>since it literally is a complete hole in the wall, it's a bit intimidating at first, but you get over that very quickly as soon as the friendly staff welcomes you - don't hesitate to ask for help with what to get.</text>

<Polarity>1</Polarity>
<text>definitely not a restaurant to skip!</text>

<Polarity>1</Polarity>
<text>the lava cake dessert was incredible and i recommend it.</text>

<text>an oasis of refinement:  food, though somewhat uneven, often reaches the pinnacles of new american fine cuisine - chef's passion (and kitchen's precise execution) is most evident in the fish dishes and soups.</text>

<text>- the bread at the beginning is super tasty and makes you want more - the pizza is delicious and comes in personal sizes, however be warned that the peter's favourite pizza with prosciutto and baby arugula is actually a margarite pizza with cold prosciutto and baby arugula on top, like a salad.</text>

<text>the appetizers are just ok and the main courses were decidedly subpar.</text>

<text>when asked about how a certain dish was prepared in comparison to a similar at other thai restaurants, he replied this is not mcdonald's, every place makes things differently while it is understandable that every place is indeed different, there was not a need to be uncourteous to customers and downright rude.</text>

<text>maybe i say so because it looked promising for people who like artery-clogging jewish deli food, but turns out to be poorly run and awful.</text>

<text>the takeout menu says to keep an eye out for an expanded menu offering more italian dishes, i can't wait!</text>

<text>if the omakase is to showcase technique and variety, serving almost 40% of items bbq-ed and a spicy tuna roll wrapped with not-so-fresh nori seems to be a rather limp performance.</text>

<text>they did not have mayonnaise, forgot our toast, left out ingredients (ie cheese in an omelet), below hot temperatures and the bacon was so over cooked it crumbled on the plate when you touched it.</text>

<Polarity>1</Polarity>
<text>i understand the area and folks you need not come here for the romantic, alluring ambiance or the five star service featuring a sommlier and a complicated maze of captain and back waiters - you come for the authentic foods, the tastes, the experiance.</text>

<text>besides having the table we had been promised given to other restaurant patrons twice before we were actually seated, we were served dishes we hadn't ordered three times, received one of our orders 20 minutes after the rest of the table had been served (and that order was undercooked), and charged $45 more than we should have been on our bill.</text>

<text>but when we looked at the menu, there weren't a lot of choices, most of them were dumplings in the appetizer section.</text>

<text>if you wrote a bad review, it's because you don't understand what rao's is all about.</text>

<Polarity>1</Polarity>
<text>i would go back tho.</text>

<Polarity>1</Polarity>
<text>the waitstaff were very nice and suggested swordfish for my husband he enjoyed his meal.</text>

<Polarity>1</Polarity>
<text>the only thing more wonderful than the food (which is exceptional) is the service.</text>

<Polarity>1</Polarity>
<text>it's also attached to angel's share, which is a cool, more romantic bar...</text>

<text>if your favorite chinese food is general tao chicken, then this is not your place.</text>

<Polarity>0</Polarity>
<text>the hostess and the waitress were incredibly rude and did everything they could to rush us out.</text>

<Polarity>0</Polarity>
<text>it could have been handled better.</text>

<Polarity>0</Polarity>
<text>even with the prix fixe pricing, this restaurant is not worth it.</text>

<Polarity>0</Polarity>
<text>food is average, and i would say even the chain restaurant baluchi's tastes better.</text>

<Polarity>0</Polarity>
<text>definitely not worth the price!</text>

<Polarity>0</Polarity>
<text>also a little more expensive than your average bagel place.</text>

<text>the man that was hosting promised to save a table for our party of 7, then sat a party of 2 at the very table he was saving (mean while there were boths open all around).</text>

<Polarity>1</Polarity>
<text>the pad thai is excellent here, as well.</text>

<Polarity>1</Polarity>
<text>faan's got a great concept but a little rough on the delivery.</text>

<Polarity>1</Polarity>
<text>they might be all business at the counter when you give your order, but their food says i love you.</text>

<Polarity>0</Polarity>
<text>they were such a rip-off ($8.95 for four small meat patties in steamed buns) and not worth trying.</text>

<Polarity>1</Polarity>
<text>i love the fact that the pizza tastes so good and is so cheap.</text>

<text>went there with my wife and we had to wait for a table even though you could see there many that were empty with not reservation sigh on them.</text>

<Polarity>0</Polarity>
<text>i dont how this place is still running.</text>

<Polarity>0</Polarity>
<text>zero ambiance to boot.</text>

<Polarity>0</Polarity>
<text>the decor is really blah, and not at all hip or happening.</text>

<text>this tiny williamsburg spot is always pleasantly surprising.</text>

<text>as soon as my father lifted his pen from the check a chef appeared to usher us out.</text>

<text>the new york times has reviewed this place three times already, you know it's going to be good.</text>

<Polarity>0</Polarity>
<text>the food was mediocre at best but it was the horrible service that made me vow never to go back.</text>

<Polarity>1</Polarity>
<text>fresh ingredients and everything is made to order.</text>

<Polarity>1</Polarity>
<text>by far this is the only chinese desserts place i know in ny or anywhere close in the northeastern america that serves desserts with frog jelly in a couple of varieties and pig feet ginger simmered in black vinegar.</text>

<text>when we were finally seated our waitress came by twice-1 for our order and 2-for our check.</text>

<Polarity>1</Polarity>
<text>ive been here a bunch of times now and the service is always outstanding.</text>

<Polarity>0</Polarity>
<text>we were very disappointed.</text>

<Polarity>1</Polarity>
<text>anyway, the food is good, the price is right and they have a decent wine list.</text>

<Polarity>0</Polarity>
<text>there is also very limited seating and there can be a substantial wait in getting food at peak times.</text>

<Polarity>0</Polarity>
<text>the rice was poor quality and was cooked so badly it was hard.</text>

<Polarity>0</Polarity>
<text>a narrow corridor leads to a tiny space where there are three tiny white tiled counters, a great deal of mess (stacks of bottles, cans) and a small counter holding 12-14 entrees.</text>

<text>lunch came with pickels and slaw, no extra charge.</text>

<text>it appears to be the owner's first venture and it shows.</text>

<text>chance is a joke.</text>

<Polarity>1</Polarity>
<text>our waitress was sweet and accomodating, not overbearing.</text>

<Polarity>0</Polarity>
<text>but the thai is definitely not great -- bland and indistinguished.</text>

<Polarity>0</Polarity>
<text>for the next hour and a half we stood in the crowded lobby area of this touristy restaurant listening to all types of explanations of why we were not being seated.</text>

<Polarity>1</Polarity>
<text>even with john's and joe's around the corner, this place will make a name for itself.</text>

<text>this place is amazingly bad.</text>

<Polarity>1</Polarity>
<text>i've been here 3 times for lunch and it is one of my favorites in the city.</text>

<Polarity>0</Polarity>
